                            Early games used interactive electronic devices with various display formats. 
                            The earliest example is from 1947—a "Cathode ray tube Amusement Device" was filed for a patent on 25 January 1947, by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann, and issued on 14 December 1948, as U.S. Patent 2455992.
                            Inspired by radar display technology, it consisted of an analog device that allowed a user to control a vector-drawn dot on the screen to simulate a missile being fired at targets, which were drawings fixed to the screen.
                            Other early examples include: Christopher Strachey's Draughts game, the Nimrod computer at the 1951 Festival of Britain; 
                            OXO a tic-tac-toe Computer game by Alexander S. Douglas for the EDSAC in 1952; 
                            Tennis for Two, an electronic interactive game engineered by William Higinbotham in 1958; 
                            Spacewar!, written by MIT students Martin Graetz, Steve Russell, and Wayne Wiitanen's on a DEC PDP-1 computer in 1961; 
                            And the hit ping pong-style Pong, a 1972 game by Atari. 
                            Each game used different means of display: NIMROD used a panel of lights to play the game of Nim, OXO used a graphical display to play tic-tac-toe Tennis for Two used an oscilloscope to display a side view of a tennis court, and Spacewar! used the DEC PDP-1's vector display to have two spaceships battle each other.

                            <p class="text-black mb-0">Video game graphics have evolved quickly in the last few decades, taking advantage of faster processors, cheaper memory, and enormous advances in video card technology.

                                Early games turned lemons into lemonade by creating text-based adventure games with simple still images, since it was impossible to make the rich visuals come to life at that time. 
                                
                                Fast-forward to today, and many games are cinematic in scope, filled with lush images that are nearly photo-realistic.
                                
                                To get a sense of just how far they've come, let's compare the original version of classic video games to their most recent iteration, or modern games that were inspired by old classics. We've rounded up 11 games to compare how they've grown up.</p>

                                    <p class="mb-0 text-white">For those of a certain age, "Castle Wolfenstein" was a beloved top-down adventure shooter, inspired by the World War II movie "The Guns of Navarrone," which appeared in 1981 on the Apple II. It spawned many sequels — notably 1992's pivotal "Wolfenstein 3D," which was a template for the modern first-person shooter. 

                                        The graphics were chunky and cartoonish, but when IGN took a look back at the game in 2012, it marveled at the little things "like Blazkowicz' stern face peering out from the bottom of the screen. As he takes damage, his face will become increasingly bloodied."</p>

                                        Today’s games are in high definition and often run at higher frame rates than they did even two decades ago. 
                                        The graphics also look much more realistic. More realistic than anyone could have predicted just a few decades ago. 
                                        Many games are cinematic in scope and filled with luscious images that are almost photo-realistic.
                                        Every gaming studio is now working on the next generation of games, and they are sure to look even more realistic.
